# Pacmen Factory

This project took knowledge in JavaScript and the Document Object Model to generate an infinite number of Pacmen moving in random directions within a box.

Improvements: These PacMen would stand no chance against me, in singular or multiple. What they need are teeth. Yes, more teeth. To make them fearsome. Though they could never be as fearsome as me. I have been known to make bears quiver in fear.
